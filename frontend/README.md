# Frontend

This frontend is powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and React.

## Available scripts

In the project directory run:

- `npm run dev` – start the development server (also aliased as `npm start`).
- `npm run build` – build the app for production.
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally.

Environment variables that need to be exposed to the client should be prefixed with `VITE_`. For example, define `VITE_API_URL` to configure the backend base URL used by the application.
